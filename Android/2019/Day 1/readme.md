# Assignment #1

Yay!   This is your time to shine!  Your time to make things.  Its your time to get things done!   Lets go!

I have a problem finding things.  I put things down and never remember where I left them so I will spend way to much time finding things.   Then when I am looking I find things that I couldn't find before and then put those into places that I cannot find.   That or I use or "play" with it for a bit, and then put it in a spot that I will never forget where I put it that I will forget about 10 minutes later.   You follow?

Anyway, I want you to think of your home.   I want you to take a picture of inside home (or steal a picture online that you wish your home was like) . Then put that as a sprite in the background.

Then I would like you to put in the following things:

* atleast 10 different things that might fit into that image that are on top.

* when you type a key or click on a location of the picture (orginal or the sprites), something pops up, disappears or change in some way.

Have fun with it.   It mights be a fun way to do pop up scares too.   I will post videos hopefully tonight.
