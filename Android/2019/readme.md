# Welcome

Thank you for joining SI@UCF 2019!

This is a list of everything we do in lectures.  Each day we will be creating a new entry for you to look at.   The code is always changing, so something we did one day, could be compeletly reworked another day.   However, we promise to upload the projects in their entireity.

I hope you have a great time!
