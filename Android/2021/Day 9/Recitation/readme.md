# Recitation Day 8 & 9: Pathfinding #

In this two-part lecture, Mike introduced several different algorithms commonly used to find the ideal path between two points. We looked at Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A*. Mike also showed how he created a path finding graph for his tank game and implemented the A* algorithm to enable the tank to find its way around the environment.
