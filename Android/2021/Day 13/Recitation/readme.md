# Recitation Day 13: Dying and respawning #

In this lecture, Mike added a consequence for having your tank take too much damage. If your tank's health reaches zero, it gets destroyed and you will have to wait five seconds to respawn, losing 100 points. We also gave the enemy tank some missiles to fire at the player as an added threat.
